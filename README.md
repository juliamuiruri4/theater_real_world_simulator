Theater x has been receiving poor reviews due to their long wait times. The manager, who is just as concerned about cost as he is about customer satisfaction, can only afford to keep so many employees on staff. He is particularly worried about what chaos can unfold once those blockbusters start coming out: lines wrapping around the theater, employees stretched to their limit, angry moviegoers missing the opening scenesâ€¦ This is definitely a situation to avoid! After checking the reviews, the manager was able to determine that a given moviegoer to their theater is willing to spend at most 10 minutes from the time they arrive until the time they get a seat. Develop a way to get customer wait times under this 10 minute requirement.
